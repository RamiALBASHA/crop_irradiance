Uniform crops
=============
Irradiance absorption by uniform crops is simulated following two methods. In the first one, no distinction is made
between direct and diffuse irradiance components. In this case, what is calculated is the absorbed "lumped" irradiance.
In the second method, absorbed irradiance quantities that come from the direct (beam) and diffuse irradiance components
are calculated separately, resulting in the absorbed irradiance by the so-called "sunlit" and "shaded" leaf fractions.
